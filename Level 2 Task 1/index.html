                            by Emperor Shah Jahān (reigned 1628-58) to honor his wife Mumtāz Maḥal (“Chosen One of the
                            Palace”), who died in 1631 giving birth to their 14th child. It took about 22 years and
                            20,000 workers to construct the complex, which includes an immense garden with a reflecting
                            pool.</p>

                            miles (8,850 km) long; a disputed Chinese study, however, claims the length is 13,170 miles
                            (21,200 km). Work began in the 7th century BCE and continued for two millennia. </p>

                            influenced by the Toltecs—a number of important monuments and temples were built. Among the
                            most notable is the stepped pyramid El Castillo (“The Castle”), which rises 79 feet (24

                            capital, and during this time it flourished, becoming an important trade center, especially
                            for spices. </p>

                            16th-century rebellion against Spanish rule. Although that claim was later disproved, the
                            purpose of Machu Picchu has confounded scholars. Bingham believed it was home to the
                            “Virgins of the Sun,” women who lived in convents under a vow of chastity. </p>

                            designed by Heitor da Silva Costa, Carlos Oswald, and Paul Landowski. Construction began in
                            1926 and was completed five years later. </p>
