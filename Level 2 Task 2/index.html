        <h2>Media Queries</h2>
        <p>
        <h3>1. Introduction to Media Queries:</h3>
        Media queries in CSS allow you to apply different styles based on various factors such as screen size, device
        orientation, and resolution. They are crucial for creating responsive designs that adapt seamlessly to different
        devices and screen sizes.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h3>2. Syntax and Structure:</h3>
        Media queries begin with the @media rule, followed by a media type (e.g., screen, print) and optional media
        feature expressions enclosed in parentheses. For example:
        <pre>
    @media screen and (max-width: 768px)
     {
         /* CSS rules for screens with a maximum 
         width of 768 pixels */
     }
    </pre>
        </p>

        <p>
        <h3>
            3. Using Media Features:
        </h3>

        Media features enable you to target specific characteristics of the user's device, such as width, height,
        orientation, and resolution. For instance:
        <pre>

    @media (orientation: landscape) 
    {
        /* CSS rules for devices in landscape 
        orientation */
    }
</pre>
        </p>
        <p>
        <h3>
            4. Common Use Cases:
        </h3>

        Media queries are commonly used to create responsive layouts, adjust typography and font sizes, modify image
        sizes and positioning, and hide or show elements based on screen size. For example:
        <pre>
        @media screen and (max-width: 576px) {
            /* Adjust layout for small screens */
        }
    
        @media (min-resolution: 300dpi) {
            /* Apply high-resolution styles for devices 
            with high pixel density */
        }
    </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
        <h3>
            5. Best Practices:
        </h3>

        When using media queries, it's essential to start with a mobile-first approach by applying styles for smaller
        screens first, then progressively enhancing the design for larger screens. Additionally, test your design across
        various devices and screen sizes to ensure optimal responsiveness.
